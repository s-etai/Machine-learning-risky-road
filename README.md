# Teaching AI to play Risky Road

A **Unity ML-Agents** project demonstrating reinforcement learning in a 2D environment.  
Developed using **Unity**, **ML-Agents**, and **PyTorch**.

## Project Overview

In this project, an AI agent learns to play a recreation of the mobile game [Risky Road](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.riskyroad). The game is a 2D challenge where you drive a pickup truck carrying an egg in the bed. The goal is to navigate tricky terrain without letting the egg fall.  

I trained a reinforcement learning model that surpasses human performance: the AI achieves a high score of 160, compared to my personal best of 50.
